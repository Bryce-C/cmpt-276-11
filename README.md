1.	Project Abstract											
People love to make predictions about the future. This is no different in the world of professional sports. At the start of every season, many fans and experts make predictions about player and team performance for the upcoming year. Once the season has finished, it is a fun exercise to compare you and your peers’ predictions to the actual outcomes. MySportsPicks is a platform that allows users to make predictions about players and teams, track them throughout the season, and compare them with others. MySportsPicks aims to provide an interactive web-based service for sports fans who currently have to track their predictions manually.

2.	Competitive Analysis											
The main online platforms for sports related games, such as Fantasy Sports, include ESPN, CBS Sports, and Yahoo Sports. Currently, none of these sites offer any service for making and tracking predictions about professional sports. This is despite the fact that all of these platforms employ professional writers and content creators who publish predictions prior to the start of various seasons. In order to track the predictions these professionals make, one has to track down the original URL for the article or post containing the predictions. There is currently no central repository for storing or tracking predictions, whether it be for these professionals or the casual fan.

The only similar service offered is in the form of online sports betting, which operates in a legal grey zone in many places and is fully illegal in Canada. Even without considering its illegal nature, sports betting sites require monetary involvement and don’t allow for group participation and interaction.

3.	Customer												
MySportsPicks is a platform for anyone who wants to make predictions about sports, whether it be the casual fan or domain professional. Professional writers can use this platform to make it easier for themselves and their readers to track their predictions. The casual fan can use it to make their personal predictions and compare these with their peers.

4.	Product Features and Scope of Project								
The main feature of MySportsPicks is that it allows a user to make predictions about the various professional sports leagues and track them throughout the season. Within this higher level feature, there are many sub features that can enhance the user experience and make the product appeal to a wider audience. Some of these features include private and public groups, leaderboards, message boards, analysis to help make predictions, tools to understand the various measures used to make predictions, and notifications. These features allow users to make their own predictions, create private groups to compare picks and compete against, view player and team stats, compare their predictions to the public and domain professionals, and track the progress of their predictions throughout the season. All of these features are available to a regular user of MySportsPicks.

An administrator of MySportsPicks has access to all users’ profiles and their information; regular users only have access to their own information. An administrator also has the ability to remove users for whatever reason, such as inappropriate behavior.

5.	Technical Specifications										
MySportsPicks will utilize an application program interface (API) that includes data on sports teams and their players. These data will be used for displaying information on a selected team or player, and also for the analysis of predictions. The MySportsPicks web application will be implemented using the Ruby on Rails web application framework, and the source code will be stored in a central repository hosted by GitHub. Initially, MySportsPicks will only be available for predictions related to basketball; additional sports can be added using different APIs in the future.
